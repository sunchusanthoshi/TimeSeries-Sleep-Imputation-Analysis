# TimeSeries-Sleep-Imputation-Analysis
Project Overview
This project investigates missing value imputation techniques for a sleep detection accelerometer time series dataset from the Child Mind Institute Kaggle Competition. It compares traditional methods (Forward Fill, Backward Fill) with advanced deep learning-based imputation using Generative Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) to evaluate their effectiveness in preserving data quality for downstream classification tasks.
